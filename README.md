## medic-system

I've decided to create same project in different languages so i could figure out which one i like the most and the less.
The project is a simple health care REST API but with some minimum rules to make it looks like a real world project.


## languages

- java
- typescript
- python
- elixir


## rules

- Must have JWT authentication
- Must be deployed somewhere
- Must have tests
- Must use the respective ORM of language's framework


## entities 

- patients
- doctors
- users
- exams
